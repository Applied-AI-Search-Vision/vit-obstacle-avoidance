# 2D Obstacle Avoidance with Vision Transformer

This project aims to train a dot in a 2D environment to avoid obstacles using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and a Vision Transformer (ViT). The 2D environment is constructed using `pygame`, and the RL and ViT components are built with `PyTorch`.

## Project Status

The project is currently a work in progress. The main objective of obstacle avoidance using the Vision Transformer is yet to be fully realized. Nonetheless, this endeavor serves as an essential groundwork for integrating Vision Transformers in RL contexts.
